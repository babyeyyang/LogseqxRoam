# Logseq x Roam
Hey guys!
I have modified Logseq to give us an **aesthetics** similar to that of Roam Research!

You can use this code with Stylus. 
Do post imporovements/additions that you would like to see in the issue section.

Big thanks to @tiensonqin for devoloping Logseq! Its an amazing platform, and can be modified with extreme ease to suite our requirements! Onwards and upwards!

You can install the custom theme using Stylus on Google Chrome.
